VirTEE is an Open Community dedicated to building FLOSS components to enable the construction of Virtualization-based TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) using technologies such as [AMD SEV](https://developer.amd.com/sev/) (and [SNP](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf)), [Intel TDX](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html) and [Armv9 Realms](https://www.arm.com/why-arm/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture).

## Communication channels

- Chat: [#virtee on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#virtee:matrix.org)

## Current projects

- [libkrun-SEV](https://github.com/containers/libkrun): A dynamic library providing Virtualization-based process isolation capabilities, also capable of creating TEEs using AMD SEV(-ES).

- [sev-attestation-server](https://github.com/slp/sev-attestation-server): An example attestation server for AMD SEV(-ES).

- [sevctl](https://github.com/virtee/sevctl): A command line utility for managing the AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) platform.

- [sev](https://github.com/virtee/sev): Rust abstraction library for the SEV API.

## FAQ

### What is a TEE?

According to the [CCC](https://confidentialcomputing.io/) (Confidential Computing Consortium), a TEE is as an environment that provides a level of assurance of the following three properties:

- **Data confidentiality**: Unauthorized entities cannot view data while it is in use within the TEE.
- **Data integrity**: Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter data while it is in use within the TEE.
- **Code integrity**: Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter code executing in the TEE.

For more information, check [this whitepaper](https://confidentialcomputing.io/whitepaper-02-latest/) published by the CCC.

### What is a Virtualization-based TEE?

It's a TEE that's constructed using [Hardware-assisted Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization), combined with other technologies (AMD SEV, Intel TDX or Armv9 Realms) that enable the guest owner to verify the integrity and confidentiality of the Virtual Machine.
